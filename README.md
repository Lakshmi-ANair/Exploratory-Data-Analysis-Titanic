# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis performed on the Titanic dataset.

## Dataset

[Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)

## Objective

The goal of this EDA was to understand the Titanic dataset's structure, content, and patterns using descriptive statistics and various visualization techniques before any formal modeling. This involved:
- Generating summary statistics.
- Visualizing distributions of numeric features (histograms, boxplots).
- Analyzing relationships between features (correlation matrix, pairplot).
- Identifying patterns, trends, anomalies, and missing data.
- Making basic inferences based on the analysis.

## Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files in this Repository

- `titanic.csv`: The dataset file containing passenger information.
- `Titanic_EDA_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code, visualizations, step-by-step analysis, and findings.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., virtual environment files).

## Summary of Findings

- **Data Quality:** Identified missing values in 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'. 'Fare' contained some extreme outlier values.
- **Survival Factors:** Survival rates were significantly higher for Females compared to Males. Passengers in Pclass 1 had higher survival rates than Pclass 2 or 3.
- **Feature Distributions:** 'Age' distribution is somewhat normal but slightly right-skewed. 'Fare' is highly right-skewed.
- **Correlations:** 'Pclass' showed a negative correlation with 'Fare' and 'Survived'.
- **Key Inferences:** 'Sex', 'Pclass', 'Fare', and potentially 'Age' appear to be important features for predicting survival. The high number of missing 'Cabin' values makes it challenging to use directly without imputation or feature engineering.

2.  Clone this repository
3.  Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal.
4.  Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
5.  Open the `Titanic_EDA_Analysis.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface in your browser.

## Possible Questions

---

### Purpose of EDA
- Understand the structure, content, and patterns within a dataset before formal modeling.
- Identify data quality issues (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies).
- Discover underlying trends, relationships, and anomalies.
- Formulate hypotheses and select appropriate features for modeling.
- Determine suitable statistical modeling or machine learning techniques.
- Summarize data using statistics and visualizations.

### How Do Boxplots Help in Understanding a Dataset?

- They visually summarize the distribution of a numerical variable using five key statistics: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum.
- Clearly show the central tendency (median) and spread (Interquartile Range, IQR = Q3 - Q1).
- Help identify the skewness of the distribution (by the position of the median and length of whiskers).
- Highlight potential outliers (points beyond 1.5 × IQR from the quartiles).
- Allow easy comparison of distributions across different categories (e.g., comparing 'Age' distributions for 'Survived' vs. 'Not Survived').

### What is Correlation and Why is it Useful?

- **Definition:**  
  Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two numerical variables. It ranges from **-1** (perfect negative) to **+1** (perfect positive), with **0** indicating no linear relationship.

- **Usefulness:**
  - Helps identify potential predictor variables for a target variable.
  - Helps detect multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors), which can destabilize machine learning models.
  - Guides feature selection and feature engineering efforts.
  - Provides insights into how different aspects of the data relate to each other.

> **Important:** Correlation does **NOT** imply causation.

### How to Detect Skewness in Data

*Visually:*
- **Histograms:**
  - Tail longer on the right → Right-skewed (positive skew).
  - Tail longer on the left → Left-skewed (negative skew).
- **Boxplots:**
  - Median closer to Q1 → Right-skewed.
  - Median closer to Q3 → Left-skewed.

*Statistically:*
- **Mean vs. Median:**
  - Mean > Median → Right-skewed.
  - Mean < Median → Left-skewed.
  - Mean ≈ Median → Symmetric distribution.

- **Skewness Coefficient:**
  - > 0 → Right skew.
  - < 0 → Left skew.
  - ≈ 0 → Symmetric.
  
> **Rule of Thumb:**  
> |Skewness| > 0.5 → Moderate skew.  
> |Skewness| > 1 → High skew.

### What is Multicollinearity?

- **Definition:**  
  Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor (independent) variables in a regression model are highly correlated.

- **Problems Caused:**
  - Makes estimated coefficients unreliable and difficult to interpret (signs may flip, magnitudes may inflate).
  - Increases standard errors of coefficients, leading to statistically insignificant results.

- **Detection Methods:**
  - Correlation matrices (look for absolute values > 0.7 or 0.8).
  - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) scores.

### Tools Used for EDA

**Core Libraries:**
- `Pandas`: For data loading, cleaning, manipulation, basic statistics (`.describe()`, `.info()`, `.value_counts()`, `.isnull()`, grouping, merging).
- `NumPy`: Foundational library for numerical operations.

**Visualization Libraries:**
- `Matplotlib`: Fundamental plotting library for custom plots.
- `Seaborn`: High-level interface built on Matplotlib for attractive and informative graphics.
- `Plotly`: Interactive visualizations for exploration and dashboards.

**Environment:**
- `Jupyter Notebook` / `Jupyter Lab`: Ideal for combining code, visualizations, and narrative text.

**Optional/Advanced Tools:**
- `Pandas Profiling`, `Sweetviz`: Libraries that automate parts of the initial EDA process.

### Example: When EDA Helped Find a Problem

- **Customer Churn Prediction Example:**
  - During EDA, the 'Total Monthly Charges' feature was found to be stored as a string (`object`) instead of a numeric type.
  - Using `.value_counts()`, it was revealed that some entries contained spaces, '$' symbols, or 'N/A'.
  - This data type inconsistency was caught early through EDA techniques like `.info()` and investigating unexpected values.
  - The column was cleaned and converted to numeric, allowing proper analysis and modeling.

- **Sales Data Analysis Example:**
  - A boxplot of 'Order Quantity' showed extreme outliers.
  - Further investigation revealed data entry errors or potentially fraudulent bulk orders.
  - Handling these outliers separately improved forecasting model accuracy.

### Role of Visualization in Machine Learning

- **Understanding Data (EDA):**
  - Histograms, scatter plots, boxplots uncover patterns, relationships, and outliers.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Visualizing feature distributions can suggest transformations (e.g., log-transform for skewed features).
  - Plotting feature-target relationships can suggest new features.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Visualizations like predicted vs. actual plots, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and learning curves assess model performance.

- **Interpreting Results:**
  - Plots like feature importance, SHAP value plots, and partial dependence plots explain model behavior.

- **Communication:**
  - Effective visualizations convey complex insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
